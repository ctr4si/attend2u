This project hosts the code for our **CVPR 2017** paper and **TPAMI 2018** paper.

- Cesc Chunseong Park, Byeongchang Kim and Gunhee Kim. *Attend to You*: Personalized Image Captioning with Context Sequence Memory Networks. In *CVPR*, 2017. (**Spotlight**) [[arxiv]](https://arxiv.org/abs/1704.06485)
- Cesc Chunseong Park, Byeongchang Kim and Gunhee Kim. Towards Personalized Image Captioning via Multimodal Memory Networks. In *IEEE TPAMI*, 2018. [[pdf]](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/8334621/)

We address personalization issues of image captioning, which have not been discussed yet in previous research.
For a query image, we aim to generate a descriptive sentence, accounting for prior knowledge such as the user's active vocabularies in previous documents.
As applications of personalized image captioning, we tackle two post automation tasks: hashtag prediction and post generation, on our newly collected Instagram dataset, consisting of 1.1M posts from 6.3K users.
We propose a novel captioning model named Context Sequence Memory Network (CSMN).

## *InstaPIC-1.1M* Dataset

*InstaPIC-1.1M* is our newly collected Instagram dataset, where PIC denotes Personalized Image Captioning.

For dataset collection, we select 270 search keywords by gathering the 10 most common hashtags for each of the following 27 generated categories of Pinterest: celebrities, design, education, food, drink, gardening, hair, health, fitness, history, humor, decor, outdoor, illustration, quotes, product, sports, technology, travel, wedding, tour, car, football, animal, pet, fashion and worldcup.

Key statistics of *InstaPIC-1.1M* dataset are outlined below.
We also show average and median (in parentheses) values.
The total unique posts and users in our dataset are (1,124,815/6,315)

| Dataset       | #posts        | #users        | #posts/user | #words/post |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| caption       | 721,176       | 4,820         | 149.6 (118) | 8.55 (8)    |
| hashtag       | 518,116       | 3,633         | 142.6 (107) | 7.45 (7)    |

If you download and uncompress the dataset correctly, structure of dataset will follow the below structure.

```

    ├── {user1_id}_@_{post2_id}
    ├── {user2_id}_@_{post1_id}
    └── ...
```

We provide two types of test set, test1 and test2.
Test1 is generated by split whole dataset by user, which means user contexts shown in this test set does not appear in training phase.
Test2 is generated by split whole dataset by posts, which means user context shown in this test set can be appear in training phase.
Since we do not provide validation set, we highly recommend you to split validation set from training set.

## *YFCC100M* Dataset

[*YFCC100M*](https://arxiv.org/abs/1503.01817) (Yahoo Flickr Creative Commons 100 Million Dataset) consists of 100 million Flickr user-uploaded images and videos between 2004 and 2014
along with their corresponding metadata including titles, descriptions, camera types and usertags.
We processed a series of filtering to make personalized image captioning split of *YFCC100M*.
We regard the titles and descriptions as captions and usertags as hashtags.

Key statistics of personalized image captioning splitted *YFCC100M* dataset are outlined below.
We also show average and median (in parentheses) values.
The total unique posts and users in our dataset are (867,922/11,093)

| Dataset       | #posts        | #users        | #posts/user | #words/post |
|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-------------:|:-----------:|:-----------:|
| caption       | 462,036       | 6,197         | 74.6 (40)   | 6.30 (5)    |
| hashtag       | 434,936       | 5,495         | 79.2 (49)   | 7.46 (6)    |
